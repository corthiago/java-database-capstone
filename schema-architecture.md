# Architecture summary
This Spring Boot application uses both MVC and REST controllers. Thymeleaf 
templates are used for the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while REST APIs serve 
all other modules. The application interacts with two databases—MySQL (for patient, 
doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongoDB (for prescriptions). 
All controllers route requests through a common service layer, which in turn 
delegates to the appropriate repositories. MySQL uses JPA entities while 
MongoDB uses document models.

# Numbered flow of data and control
1. User accesses AdminDashboard or Appointment pages.
2. The action is routed to the appropriate Thymeleaf or REST controller.
3. The controller calls the service layer
4. The service layer delegates to the appropriate repository
5. The repositories access their respective databases
6. Databases access their appropriate models
7. The models are used at the response layer
